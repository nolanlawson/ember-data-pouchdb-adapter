# Contributing | Ember Pouch
___
Hey, thanks for making a difference in the Ember Pouch community!

There are many ways you can contribute to this wonderful community.

For example, you can:
* :bug: [Report / Fix a bug](#bug).
* :scroll: [Write / Correct some documentation](#documentation).
* :rocket: [Request / Add a feature](#feature_request).
* :fire_engine: [Help other users](#help_others).

Just to name a few. Heck, you can even *come up with your own way to help*.

If you would like to help out in the form of code, but aren't sure how to get setup, go [here](#environment).

## :bug: <a name="bug"></a>Found a bug?
The first step to take, when you believe that you have found a bug is to [check the current issues](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues). Feel free to use the search bar to check for an issue that may have been resolved already.

If you can't find a match for your bug in the list of current issues, go ahead and [submit a new issue](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues/new). Please try to be as specific as possible in describing what is happening. Tell us what you expect to happen, and then what is actually happening. Perhaps even show us a `code sample`, we love those.

If you have the gusto to fix an issue, go ahead, [create a pull request :santa:](#pull_request).

## :scroll: <a name="documentation"></a>Want to add some documentation?
There is much more to a project than just writing code. Any awesome project also has awesome documentation. We ask that when [submitting a pull request](#pull_request), you update the documentation to reflect any changes that you have made.

In the event that you feel like you can make the current documentation better, go right ahead and do so. Please start by opening up a [new issue](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues/new) so that everyone can weigh in on the matter.

## :rocket: <a name="feature_request"></a>Have a feature request?
We love cool new features! :heart: Please ensure that the feature that you are requesting hasn't been [requested already](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues).

If you are requesting a new feature, simply [open a new issue](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues/new). Please remember to try to give as much detail as possible. What pain points does it solve for you? Is it a shortcut? Does it help avoid other possible issues? Perhaps even provide some code samples showing how you might use the new feature.

## :fire_engine: <a name="help_others"></a>Want to help others?
It's awesome that you want to help others, and there are many ways that you can do so here. New issues, questions, and features open and close all the time. If you have experience with using Ember Pouch, perhaps you can help other users work through their [issues](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues), or maybe you can help someone better define their new [feature](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/issues).

If you are up to the challenge, and think you might be able to fix a particular issue, perhaps consider submitting a [pull request](#pull_request).

## :santa: <a name="pull_request"></a>Want to submit a pull request?
Would you like to give the gift of a resolved issue or feature request to someone? Then you are in the right place.

We love contributions :gift:, frankly who doesn't? Please make sure that before you [submit a new pull request](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/compare) you do the following:
* Add any applicable [documentation](#documentation).
* Add any needed tests (help prevent these guys :bug: :bomb:).
* Test your changes locally.

In the event that you don't know what tests might be needed, or aren't sure how to write a test, don't let that stop you from submitting. Go ahead and [create your pull request](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch/compare) and ask us for some advice.
